## Pro Tips for Advanced Analysis

### 1. Sample Size Matters

- **10-15 songs**: Quick insights
- **20-30 songs**: Reliable patterns
- **50+ songs**: Comprehensive analysis

### 2. Mix Different Tools

Don't just use one! Combine:
```
- Explicitness + Genres = "Clean electronic playlist"
- Diversity + Top Artists = "Balanced favorites list"
- Genres + Collection Analysis = "Mood validation"
```

### 3. Use for Discovery

```
"My genres show 80% rock but only 3 subgenres.
Recommend more diverse rock subgenres to explore."
```

### 4. Seasonal Analysis

```
Compare:
- Summer playlist genres
- Winter playlist genres
Find: Seasonal preferences!
```

### 5. Social Comparisons

```
Friend A genres: 60% hip-hop, 30% R&B
Friend B genres: 50% indie, 40% alternative
Overlap: Find shared genres for collaborative playlist!
```

## Common Questions

### Q: How accurate is the genre classification?
**A:** Spotify assigns genres to artists (not individual songs). Multiple artists = multiple genre tags. Very accurate for most mainstream music!

### Q: Why do some songs have many genres?
**A:** Artists can fit multiple categories! A song by Coldplay might be tagged: "pop", "rock", "alternative", "british rock", etc.

### Q: Can I analyze a playlist link?
**A:** Not directly with these tools. Use `analyze_playlist` for Spotify playlist IDs, or manually list songs for advanced analysis.

### Q: What if a song isn't on Spotify?
**A:** It won't be found. Analysis continues with other songs and reports errors.

### Q: Is this data private?
**A:** Yes! All analysis happens locally through your Spotify account. Nothing is stored or shared.

### Q: Can I export the results?
**A:** Ask Claude to create a report or export to CSV! It can format the JSON nicely.
